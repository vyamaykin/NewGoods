## Detailed Analysis

### Store Performance Analysis

The correlation analysis showed a strong positive relationship (0.98) between quantity sold and sales value, indicating that stores selling more items generally generate higher revenue, as expected.

#### Sell-Through Rate Performance

The sell-through rate analysis identified Jefferson City as the standout performer with an exceptional rate of 438.2%, followed by St. Charles (148.5%), Marion (137.9%), and Columbia (126.6%). These high sell-through rates indicate these stores are efficiently converting inventory into sales, suggesting strong demand and effective merchandising strategies.

Several stores showed infinite sell-through rates in our analysis, which typically indicates that these stores sold more items than they received in inventory during the analysis period. This could be due to selling through previous period inventory or potential data recording issues.

#### Sell-Through Rate Performance

Arbel Group, LLC also led in sell-through rate at 105.27%, followed by Regent Products Corp (95.46%) and H&J closeouts (93.33%). The high sell-through rates for these suppliers indicate strong customer demand for their products across stores.
